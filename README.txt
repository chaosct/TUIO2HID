TUIO2HID
--------

TUIO2HID translates TUIO events from reacTIVision
into keyboard events.

If you are having trouble executing the program, try
installing python (http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.2/)

Change the file "mapping.txt" to change the mapping
between fiducial IDs and Keys. If this file is not
found, the program will generate a new one.
